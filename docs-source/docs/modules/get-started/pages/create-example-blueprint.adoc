ifdef::review[REVIEWERS: it would be great to provide some comments explaining the important lines in this blueprint. If you give me the information, I can use a special annotation callout that shows onscreen, but doesn't mess up the code when the reader copies it. That might be cleaner than embedding comments.]


The blueprint declares which streamlets join together to form our pipeline. Create `blueprint.conf` in `src/main/blueprint` to specify the connection as follows:

```
blueprint {
  streamlets {
    http-ingress = sensordata.SensorDataHttpIngress
    metrics = sensordata.SensorDataToMetrics
    validation = sensordata.MetricsValidation
    valid-logger = sensordata.ValidMetricLogger
    invalid-logger = sensordata.InvalidMetricLogger
  }

  connections {
    http-ingress.out = [metrics.in]
    metrics.out = [validation.in]
    validation.invalid = [invalid-logger.in]
    validation.valid = [valid-logger.in]
  }
}
```

== What's next

With the streamlets implemented and the blueprint ready, let's try xref:run-in-sandbox.adoc[running Hello World in a development sandbox].
